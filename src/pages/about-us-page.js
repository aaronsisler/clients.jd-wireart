      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Jonathan Daniel. I was born in 1965 in Zimbabwe, then
        Rhodesia. I was born and raised on a farm. Both of my parents were
        illiterate and are still unable to read or write. My dad has been a cook
        for a white farmer for over thirty years. He has two wives, and I am the
        oldest of his nine children. Because my parents were so poor, I
        literally spent my childhood with no clothes, no money and no toys.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although we were materially poor, my family was rich in values and
        tradition. Poverty forces you to be adventurous, creative and a dreamer.
        Sometimes people make poor choices in their poor condition that result
        in bad consequences, but others make positive choices that form positive
        talents to last a lifetime. Allow me to explain:
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember as a young boy, when I asked my dad for a toy. He handed me
        an ax and said, “With this tool, you can create any toy you can
        imagine.” As strange as it sounds, he was right. I remember carrying
        that ax over my shoulder, looking at branches and envisioning
        interesting pictures of toys to be carved. I began expanding my
        imagination of what a toy should look like, and I enriched my
        perceptions in creating ideas. I became adventurous so that I started to
        utilize the environment around me for all my basic needs.

        On the farm, I had often seen machinery such as a truck or a tractor,
        but I hadn’t seen the other “animals of the road” when I was young.
        There was a grocery store, merely three miles away from the farm, which
        we visited each day to buy bread and milk. When I was old enough to make
        this trip for the family’s only two food items, I began to see cars and
        trucks that I had never imagined. I was fascinated by the beauty and
        strangeness of them all. With each new vehicle I saw, I would run all
        three miles home and share what I had seen. Because I was unable to
        describe the kind of vehicle, I began carrying a piece of scrap wire
        around my neck. That way, when I saw a car of interest, I could use the
        wire to make the outlined shape of it and take it home to share. Next, I
        began to add to the wire vehicle, to the point where I had created a
        completed vehicle out of trash and was able to “push-drive” them
        everywhere I went. I would even drive my trucks to the store and load
        them up with the daily bread and milk items.
      </p>
      <p>I quickly acquired the nickname “Wire Boy” from those on the farm.</p>
      <p>
        The humble artistic beginnings of my wire art blossomed when I came to
        the United States to study aircraft mechanics. The story of the
        development of my craft and how it helped me to fund my schooling is an
        interesting one as well. Although I had my own plans to return
        immediately to Zimbabwe after schooling, I had to unselfishly decide to
        use my gifts and talents of working with youth to be a Youth Minister in
        North Carolina. Although I love working with youth in America, I have
        never lost my passion for the work still to be done in my own country of
        Zimbabwe.
